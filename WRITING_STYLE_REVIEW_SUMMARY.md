- Callback to previous posts ("Remember when we...")
- Direct problem statement ("Let's start with something we've all seen...")
- Setting expectations ("Here's what we'll be covering...")

### 2. Transitions (3 Energy Levels)
- **Energetic**: "crack into", "kick into it", "Without any further ado"
- **Formal**: "Pivoting to", "We now switch focus to"
- **Questions**: "What should I do?", "Want to add a new feature?"

### 3. Parenthetical Asides (3 Types)
- **Dismissive**: "(Whether X is good is another topic...)"
- **Reader-directive**: "(If this looks familiar, skip ahead...)"
- **Personal**: "(I prefer the former)", "(I don't actually know...)"

### 4. Casual Humor & Wordplay
- Puns on method names ("We should all try to get along...")
- Playful descriptions ("Boom! Crashes if...")

### 5. Explanatory Style (4 Patterns)

- Sharing personal preferences ("I'd argue that...")
- Acknowledging nuance ("As usual, caveats apply...")

### 6. Rhetorical Questions (4 Usage Types)

- Guide exploration ("What if we need...?")
- Create emphasis ("Look at what we can do now:")
- Address reader directly ("You can see the problem already")

### 7. Section Organization
- **Technical**: "The Problem: Giant Methods" (not just "The Problem")
- **Reviews**: "Must Watch", "Dive deeper into specifics"
- **Principles**: "The Inheritance Trap", "Enter Composition"
- Outcome-oriented over generic labels

### 8. Emphatic Language
- Strong recommendations ("I highly recommend")
- Definitive statements ("The crux of CICD is:")
- Pragmatic caveats (strong opinion + acknowledging complexity)
- Direct problem statements ("It's a nightmare to maintain")

### 9. Audience Acknowledgment
- Diverse experience levels ("Whether you're new to X or already using X...")
